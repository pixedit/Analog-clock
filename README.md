# Analog clock

This is a simple analog clock web app built for <span style="color:#FF6F61">learning</span> and <span style="color:#FF6F61">practice</span> purposes, and I hope you find it interesting.

It features a clean layout with subtle animations to replicate the motion of a **real clock**. Designed as part of my front-end learning journey.
